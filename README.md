# Email to the Young Developer
I was recently asked to share any resources or tips I had for a student that recently graduated high school with a passion for programming. After composing the email, I decided to post the body of it here in case it can help other individuals. I'm unsure if it will be a "living document" or a timepiece of advice from the end of 2018.

If his passion is programming, regardless of if he plans to be a web developer or not, these resources are great (free) building blocks that I've referenced over the years:

* Codecademy for basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery fundamentals: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website, https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript, https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-jquery
* Free Code Camp for a fantastic and free curriculum that covers the basics through advanced, modern frameworks: https://www.freecodecamp.org/, curriculum outline https://learn.freecodecamp.org/
* This is a resource that I found recently, which is a roadmap to being either a front-end or back-end web developer. It does link to paid Udemy courses, but in my experience that's where you get amazing value for very little money. https://codeburst.io/the-2018-web-developer-roadmap-826b1b806e8d
* I didn't follow this guide, but it is pretty much an exhaustive learn-at-home gameplan written by a guy who got a job as a developer after 9 months of home learning: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-went-from-newbie-to-software-engineer-in-9-months-while-working-full-time-460bd8485847

JavaScript is probably the best language to learn right now, because it can be used for both front end web sites, as well as back end server logic using NodeJS and the Node Package Manager. JavaScript can also be used to write native Android and iOS applications using React-Native, which is an extension of the React framework (the courses I bought and enjoyed on Udemy for these frameworks are https://www.udemy.com/share/1002M0A0IadFdaRXw=/?xref=share and https://www.udemy.com/share/1004YiA0IadFdaRXw=/?xref=share).

One thing I would recommend for this person is to start building something as soon as he has barely enough knowledge to build just that something. It can be super small and basic, but then as he learns more he can expand it and lock in the knowledge by applying what he learns.

It's cliche, but I've always gotten motivation to keep going from Steve Jobs' commencement speech, because sometimes it's hard to keep going when you keep hitting walls when building your first pieces of software: https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc

*(Here were some comments about local universities and their programs.)* Even if he doesn't go for University, he should use an app like Meetup to find a coding group so he can sharpen his skills, learn what else is going on in the software scene, get help with those seemingly impossible bugs that will come up, and get re-energized to learn and grow in the field.

I hope that will help them in at least some way, but at the very least now I have a central place to find these links :)

Well wishes,
Coulter
